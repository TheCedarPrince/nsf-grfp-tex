% TODO: This first paragraph should talk a little bit more about prior experiences
\textbf{Personal Background:} I could scarcely remain focused as I walked through the narrow psychiatric ward of a children's hospital nestled in the rural countryside of Guatemala.
The irreconcilable struggle in wanting to drop everything in service to those children while keeping focus on my medical anthropology training was amongst the cruelest lessons I have ever been taught.
There was nothing I could do for a hospital with too few resources and far too much need -- then.

% TODO: Talk about professional career further
In my early training as an engineer and scientist, I have made it a point to never remove myself "too far from direct application" and the challenge of bridging theory to practice.
With the COVID19 pandemic raging at its peak and my freshly minted spring of $2020$ BS training in biomedical engineering completed, I was eager to bring my training in biomedical engineering to bear on this challenge in my first full time job: a dual position as a research engineer at Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Centers for Disease Control.
As we worked with the CDC's COVID19 Mitigation Policy Analysis Unit, directives could change within the day.
Questions such as "what does this new data analysis tell us about this policy's effectiveness?", "did you see this new pre-print that might be useful?", "have you incorporated these fresh statistics into your analysis? Could you?" are just some of the many we had to triage while ultimately collaborating on a national response to the evolving strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

% TODO: This paragraph should talk further about my motivation to go back to graduate school
When there was a moment, I found myself coming back to a persistent nagging thought: "There must be a better way of doing this?"
What I meant was that I felt that several of the analyses we would perform were so similar but had subtle differences that would cause us to lose time in working with our CDC colleagues.
To me, it felt like there must be some fundamental abstraction that I could use to address this feeling.
It was through this discontent which led me back to graudate studies and the best field to study abstraction I felt, was mathematics. 

\textbf{Intellectual Merit:}

\textbf{Broader Impacts:} In my role as a leader in the JuliaHealth community, I have taken an active role in promoting interdiscplinary research software development. Our group has more than $250$ members  across various research communities such as JuliaHealth
